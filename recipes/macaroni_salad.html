    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup finely diced red onion (optional)</li>
        <li>2 2/3 cups mayonnaise, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 small carrots, peeled and grated</li>
        <li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using red onion, place onion in a bowl with enough cold water to cover. Set aside to soak for 20 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir mayonnaise, cider vinegar, sugar, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir in red onion immediately after draining. Stir in grated carrot; set aside.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of generously salted water to a rolling boil, and boil elbow macaroni until tender with a bite, about 5 minutes, or according to package directions. Pour into a strainer set in the sink. Run cold water over pasta until pasta is cooled to room temperature, about 30 seconds. Drain in the strainer for about 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour macaroni into the bowl with dressing and mix well. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, cover salad with a sheet of plastic directly touching the surface, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours and preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove salad from refrigerator and stir thoroughly. Adjust texture by stirring in a spoonful of mayonnaise and about 1/4 cup water. Stir again, and add more mayonnaise and/or water as needed. Taste for salt and adjust if needed.</li>
